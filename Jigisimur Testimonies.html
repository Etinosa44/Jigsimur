        <h2>HEADACHE AND MORE CURED</h2>
        <p>Honestly Jigsimur is a miracle in a Bottle. The issues of that constant headache l complained about to you. Has stopped, for the past 2 weeks now. I do not feel that heavy headache l complained to you about. Honestly I have spent so much on drugs for this issue. It got to a point it started affecting my eyesight. I am a big CURED to what this Jigsimur can do. This is my 3rd big bottle that I am taking now and I can notice that it is good for helping lose weight. My belly is coming down and I feel more free and able to move about more.</p>

        <h2>FIBROID CURED</h2>
        <p>A woman had fibroid here in Lagos. She had undergone surgery once, the fibroid grew again. She had miscarried twice. Somebody has introduced Jigsimur to her but  she looked down on the product. When all her efforts to get a solution proofed abortive, she resulted to Jigsimur. She called me for one bottle. I advised her on how she should administer the product. I even advised her to buy like two or three bottles but she promised to buy as that one finishes. She started the treatment and I was following her. One day she called me that she could not go out because of the clots she was discharging. I told her to put her mind at rest, that she was actually discharging the fibroid. After that, she now had six days of uninterrupted heavy flow. She was frightened and called me. I told her to have her peace. Like two days later, I called her and she told me the flow had stopped. After some days she asked me if she should buy another bottle, I asked her to go for scan. When she went for the scan, honestly everything has cleared. She told me, "Am now okay". With just one bottle.
            I had another patient of fibroid. She complained that Jigsimur was too bitter, immediately after taking Jigsimur she would be looking for something to sweeten her mouth. She also said that, people did complain that she was going lean. And that people were complaining. I told her that she could not get result. For good two months she was still on one bottle. After that bottle, I didn't even bother to call her again. 
            
            If the medicine will work, the patient also must play his/her roles very well.
            </p>

        <h2>ULCER CURED</h2>
        <p>I treated ULCERS with Jigsimur my peltic ulcer and a colleague of my that I sold to, she  didn't use up to a treatment pack before she got healing ... some people are good at following treatment instructions and advise why some are not.</p>

        <h2>MULTIPLE PROBLEM CURED</h2>
        <p>Since I've been taking Jigsimur, I stopped all other drugs I used to take before because Jigsimur. It is a multipurpose drugs. Not that I stopped other drugs but I don't have any reason taking them, in fact I forgot about them. 
            Jigsimur has cured:
            Waist pain
            Body pain
            Erection dysfunction 
            Insomnia 
            </p>

        <h2>SPERM COUNT CURED</h2>
        <p>Fresh CURED of watery sperm/low sperm count, from my doubting customer. She has been chatting me for long but she kept asking me, "are you sure it will work? I have been telling my brother about it, but he said he doesn't want to waste money. He has been taking many things but none has worked." I told her if you don't try, you won't know. So September 29, 2024. She later convinced her brother to buy and they bought 3 bottles. I checked on her on 5th October, she said her brother said there is improvement. Only to break the Goodnews today 17th October, 2024. That her brother's wife is pregnant.</p>
